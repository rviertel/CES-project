	abstract = {External tufted ({ET}) cells are juxtaglomerular neurons that spontaneously generate bursts of action potentials, which persist when fast synaptic transmission is blocked. The intrinsic mechanism of this autonomous bursting is unknown. We identified a set of voltage-dependent conductances that cooperatively regulate spontaneous bursting: hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih), persistent Na+ current ({INaP}), low-voltage-activated calcium current ({IL}/T) mediated by T- and/or L-type Ca2+ channels, and large-conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ current ({IBK}). Ih is important in setting membrane potential and depolarizes the cell toward the threshold of {INaP} and {IT}/L, which are essential to generate the depolarizing envelope that is crowned by a burst of action potentials. Action potentials depolarize the membrane and induce Ca2+ influx via high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels ({IHVA}). The combined depolarization and increased intracellular Ca2+ activates {IBK}, which terminates the burst by hyperpolarizing the membrane. Hyperpolarization activates Ih and the cycle is regenerated. A novel finding is the role of L-type Ca2+ channels in autonomous {ET} cells bursting. A second novel feature is the role of {BK} channels, which regulate burst duration. {IL} and {IBK} may go hand-in-hand, the slow inactivation of {IL} requiring {IBK}-dependent hyperpolarization to deactivate inward conductances and terminate the burst. {ET} cells receive monosynaptic olfactory nerve input and drive the major inhibitory interneurons of the glomerular circuit. Modulation of the conductances identified here can regulate burst frequency, duration, and spikes per burst in {ET} cells and thus significantly shape the impact of glomerular circuits on mitral and tufted cells, the output channels of the olfactory bulb.},

	abstract = {Olfaction in mammals is a dynamic process driven by the inhalation of air through the nasal cavity. Inhalation determines the temporal structure of sensory neuron responses and shapes the neural dynamics underlying central olfactory processing. Inhalation-linked bursts of activity among olfactory bulb ({OB}) output neurons (mitral/tufted cells, {MCs}) are temporally transformed relative to those of sensory neurons. We investigated how {OB} circuits shape inhalation-driven dynamics in {MCs} using a modeling approach that was highly constrained by experimental results. First, we constructed models of canonical {OB} circuits that included mono- and disynaptic feedforward excitation, recurrent inhibition and feedforward inhibition of the {MC}. We then used experimental data to drive inputs to the models and to tune parameters; inputs were derived from sensory neuron responses during natural odorant sampling (sniffing) in awake rats, and model output was compared to recordings of {MC} responses to odorants sampled with the same sniff waveforms. This approach allowed us to identify {OB} circuit features underlying the temporal transformation of sensory inputs into inhalation-linked patterns of {MC} spike output. We found that realistic input-output transformations can be achieved independently by multiple circuits, including feedforward inhibition with slow onset and decay kinetics and parallel feedforward {MC} excitation mediated by external tufted cells. We also found that recurrent and feedforward inhibition had differential impacts on {MC} firing rates and on inhalation-linked response dynamics. These results highlight the importance of investigating neural circuits in a naturalistic context and provide a framework for further explorations of signal processing by {OB} networks.},

	abstract = {The {BK} channel is a Ca2+ and voltage-gated conductance responsible for shaping action potential waveforms in many types of neurons. Type {II} {BK} channels are differentiated from type I channels by their pharmacology and slow gating kinetics. The β4 accessory subunit confers type {II} properties on {BK} α subunits. Empirically derived properties of {BK} channels, with and without the β4 accessory subunit, were obtained using a heterologous expression system under physiological ionic conditions. These data were then used to study how {BK} channels alone (type I) and with the accessory β4 subunit (type {II}) modulate action potential properties in biophysical neuron models. Overall, the models support the hypothesis that it is the slower kinetics provided by the β4 subunit that endows the {BK} channel with type {II} properties, which leads to broadening of action potentials and, secondarily, to greater recruitment of {SK} channels reducing neuronal excitability. Two regions of parameter space distinguished type {II} and type I effects; one where the range of {BK}-activating Ca2+ was high (\&gt;20 μM) and the other where {BK}-activating Ca2+ was low (∼0.4–1.2 μM). The latter required an elevated {BK} channel density, possibly beyond a likely physiological range. {BK}-mediated sharpening of the spike waveform associated with the lack of the β4 subunit was sensitive to the properties of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels due to electrogenic effects on spike duration. We also found that depending on Ca2+ dynamics, type {II} {BK} channels may have the ability to contribute to the medium {AHP}, a property not generally ascribed to {BK} channels, influencing the frequency–current relationship. Finally, we show how the broadening of action potentials conferred by type {II} {BK} channels can also indirectly increase the recruitment of {SK}-type channels decreasing the excitability of the neuron.},

	abstract = {Wang, Xiao-Jing. Calcium coding and adaptive temporal computation in cortical pyramidal neurons. J. Neurophysiol. 79: 1549–1566, 1998. In this work, we present a quantitative theory of temporal spike-frequency adaptation in cortical pyramidal cells. Our model pyramidal neuron has two-compartments (a “soma” and a “dendrite”) with a voltage-gated Ca2+ conductance (g Ca) and a Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance (g {AHP}) located at the dendrite or at both compartments. Its frequency-current relations are comparable with data from cortical pyramidal cells, and the properties of spike-evoked intracellular [Ca2+] transients are matched with recent dendritic [Ca2+] imaging measurements. Spike-frequency adaptation in response to a current pulse is characterized by an adaptation time constant τadap and percentage adaptation of spike frequency F adap [\% (peak − steady state)/peak]. We show how τadap and F adap can be derived in terms of the biophysical parameters of the neural membrane and [Ca2+] dynamics. Two simple, experimentally testable, relations between τadap and F adap are predicted. The dependence of τadap and F adap on current pulse intensity, electrotonic coupling between the two compartments, g {AHP} as well the [Ca2+] decay time constant τCa, is assessed quantitatively. In addition, we demonstrate that the intracellular [Ca2+] signal can encode the instantaneous neuronal firing rate and that the conductance-based model can be reduced to a simple calcium-model of neuronal activity that faithfully predicts the neuronal firing output even when the input varies relatively rapidly in time (tens to hundreds of milliseconds). Extensive simulations have been carried out for the model neuron with random excitatory synaptic inputs mimicked by a Poisson process. Our findings include 1) the instantaneous firing frequency (averaged over trials) shows strong adaptation similar to the case with current pulses; 2) when the g {AHP} is blocked, the dendritic g Ca could produce a hysteresis phenomenon where the neuron is driven to switch randomly between a quiescent state and a repetitive firing state. The firing pattern is very irregular with a large coefficient of variation of the interspike intervals ({ISI} {CV} {\textgreater} 1). The {ISI} distribution shows a long tail but is not bimodal. 3) By contrast, in an intrinsically bursting regime (with different parameter values), the model neuron displays a random temporal mixture of single action potentials and brief bursts of spikes. Its {ISI} distribution is often bimodal and its power spectrum has a peak. 4) The spike-adapting current I {AHP}, as delayed inhibition through intracellular Ca2+ accumulation, generates a “forward masking” effect, where a masking input dramatically reduces or completely suppresses the neuronal response to a subsequent test input. When two inputs are presented repetitively in time, this mechanism greatly enhances the ratio of the responses to the stronger and weaker inputs, fulfilling a cellular form of lateral inhibition in time. 5) The [Ca2+]-dependent I {AHP} provides a mechanism by which the neuron unceasingly adapts to the stochastic synaptic inputs, even in the stationary state following the input onset. This creates strong negative correlations between output {ISIs} in a frequency-dependent manner, while the Poisson input is totally uncorrelated in time. Possible functional implications of these results are discussed.},

The role of {JG} neurons in odor processing is poorly understood. We investigated the morphology, spontaneous, and sensory-evoked activity of one class of {JG} neurons, external tufted ({ET}) cells, using whole-cell patch-clamp and extracellular recordings in rat olfactory bulb slices. {ET} cells have extensive dendrites that ramify within a single glomerulus or, rarely, in two adjacent glomeruli. All {ET} neurons exhibit spontaneous rhythmic bursts of action potentials (∼1–8 bursts/sec). Bursting is intrinsically generated; bursting persisted and became more regular in the presence of ionotropic glutamate and {GABA} receptor antagonists. Burst frequency is voltage dependent; frequency increased at membrane potentials depolarized relative to rest and decreased during membrane potential hyperpolarization. Spontaneous bursting persisted in blockers of calcium channels that eliminated low-threshold calcium spikes ({LTS}) in {ET} cells. {ET} cells have a persistent sodium current available at membrane potentials that generate spontaneous bursting. Internal perfusion with a fast sodium channel blocker eliminated spontaneous bursting but did not block the {LTS}. These results suggest that persistent sodium channels are essential for spontaneous burst generation in {ET} cells. {ET} cell bursts were entrained to {ON} stimuli delivered over the range of theta frequencies. Thus, {ET} cells appear to be tuned to the frequency of sniffing.},

	abstract = {Evidence for coexpression of two or more classic neurotransmitters in neurons has increased, but less is known about cotransmission. Ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) neurons corelease dopamine ({DA}), the excitatory transmitter glutamate, and the inhibitory transmitter {GABA} onto target cells in the striatum. Olfactory bulb ({OB}) short axon cells ({SACs}) form interglomerular connections and coexpress markers for {DA} and {GABA}. Using an optogenetic approach, we provide evidence that mouse {OB} {SACs} release both {GABA} and {DA} onto external tufted cells ({ETCs}) in other glomeruli. Optical activation of channelrhodopsin specifically expressed in {DAergic} {SACs} produced a {GABAA} receptor-mediated monosynaptic inhibitory response, followed by {DA}–D1-like receptor-mediated excitatory response in {ETCs}. The {GABAA} receptor-mediated hyperpolarization activates Ih current in {ETCs}; synaptically released {DA} increases Ih, which enhances postinhibitory rebound spiking. Thus, the opposing actions of synaptically released {GABA} and {DA} are functionally integrated by Ih to generate an inhibition-to-excitation “switch” in {ETCs}. Consistent with the established role of Ih in {ETC} burst firing, we show that endogenous {DA} release increases {ETC} spontaneous bursting frequency. {ETCs} transmit sensory signals to mitral/tufted output neurons and drive intraglomerular inhibition to shape glomerulus output to downstream olfactory networks. {GABA} and {DA} cotransmission from {SACs} to {ETCs} may play a key role in regulating output coding across the glomerular array.},
